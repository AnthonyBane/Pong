# Pong

This repository holds several directories and has been created to help highlight the difference between poorly written code and code written to adhere to Python and OOP standards. Each directory has a "theme" which partially determines what changes have been made.

The directories are:

* pong_1 - a poorly written script
* pong_2 - a more optimised, refactored script implementing better Python and OOP standards
* pong_3 - added logging methods to generate a log file

Note: These are not intended to be perfect examples of pong or of Python/OOP standards, just a series of scripts getting closer to it.
