# Pong

This repository holds two directories and was created to help highlight the differences between code written with poor adherence to Python and OOP standards and code written to better adhere to them.

The directories are:

* pong_1 - the poorly written script
* pong_2 - a more optimised script

Note: The second iteration is not intended to be a perfect example of pong, just a refactored and better example compared to iteration 1.
